# misc-utils
Miscellaneous stuff I wrote, mostly for tkinter

Includes:

- in the main module:
  - a table display for a terminal
  - various class wrappers
  - multiline input
  - a Tree
- a timer module, extensible but also working out of the box
- tkinter extensions (<del>may</del> probably will explode in your face):
  - container widgets
  - wrapping widgets
  - validated widgets
  - scrolled widgets
  - single widget for radion button groups (probably the most safe to use)
